/**
Terms:
  - expression: an expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Notes:
Some prorperties cannont be accessed 
through dot notation such as [0] and ['Alex Garland'] 

array[0]: 0 is the property of the array value? 

value.x access the value's properties 'x',
whereas value[x] accesses the resulting value
from x as the value's properties. Because of this 
you could access different values bases off of 
different expressions. 

Toys:
create complex property calls based off of 
expression results. This should have a purpose.
